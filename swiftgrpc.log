      leading_comments: " `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a\n URL that describes the type of the serialized message.\n\n Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form\n of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.\n\n Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.\n\n     Foo foo = ...;\n     Any any;\n     any.PackFrom(foo);\n     ...\n     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {\n       ...\n     }\n\n Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.\n\n     Foo foo = ...;\n     Any any = Any.pack(foo);\n     ...\n     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {\n       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);\n     }\n\n  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.\n\n     foo = Foo(...)\n     any = Any()\n     any.Pack(foo)\n     ...\n     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):\n       any.Unpack(foo)\n       ...\n\n The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use\n 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\n methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'\n in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\n name \"y.z\".\n\n\n JSON\n ====\n The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\n representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\n additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n     package google.profile;\n     message Person {\n       string first_name = 1;\n       string last_name = 2;\n     }\n\n     {\n       \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n       \"firstName\": <string>,\n       \"lastName\": <string>\n     }\n\n If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\n representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\n field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n     {\n       \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n       \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n     }\n\n"

      leading_comments: " A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the\n serialized protocol buffer message.\n\n For URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, the\n following restrictions and interpretations apply:\n\n * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully\n   qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).\n   The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is\n   not accepted).\n * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n   value in binary format, or produce an error.\n * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n   breaking changes.)\n\n Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\n used with implementation specific semantics.\n\n"
